**Results:** Prism has a customer retention issue, with a 77.5% annual churn rate. Google remains the top revenue channel at over Â£10M annually. Optimising Google represents untapped potential.

To understand how mobile users are using epictrips.com.

epictrips.com has seen a huge growth in the number of bookings made on mobile devices. To utilise this, epictrips.com would like to know how epictrips.com is being used.

**Results:**
Americans are booking the most trips out of any country and are primarily travelling within the US. Recommendation: Advertise more hotels in the US and target marketing efforts towards the US. The mobile app is outperforming the mobile web. Recommendation: Continually make UI/UX improvements. Travellers book holidays last minute.

**Goals:** To provide a dashboard providing analysis on which inventory to restock.

**Descriptions:** A fictional e-commerce business has been acquired and the acquiring company wants to maximise profit for the e-commerce business. They aim to do this by stocking the most profitable inventory. Given data regarding product details, product cost, product price, etc.

**Results:** Based on the analysis, I recommended that Men's Bib Shorts (sizes S and M) and Women's Tights (sizes S and L), should be the products that should have a drastic increase in inventory to maximise profit.
